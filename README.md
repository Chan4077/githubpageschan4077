# githubpageschan4077
This project aims to bring a [material2](https://github.com/angular/material2) look to the page and is generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.1.

For the moment, please view it [here](https://githubpageschan4077.firebaseapp.com).

## Notes
- In the future, the [blogspot](https://chanziyangedric.blogspot.com) will be taken down and replaced by this repo under the `/blog` URL
- This project is still under beta and may break at any time
- `npm install` may take a while to run since there are **so many** more dependencies! :(
