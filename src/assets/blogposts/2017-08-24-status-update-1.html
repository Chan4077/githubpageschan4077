<p>Currently, I've been working on some projects and I would like to announce all my projects to the public.</p>
<p>Here are the projects that I'm working on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/Chan4077/StudyBuddy"><code>StudyBuddy</code></a>
    <p>A study buddy for students. This study buddy, in the future, will have calendar support and notification channels (Android
      Oreo).</p>
    <p>It also has support for <a href="https://www.android.com/versions/oreo-8-0/">Android Oreo</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/Chan4077/material2-docs"><code>material2-docs</code></a>
    <p>Angular Material Docs with more examples and a copy button for code.</p>
    <!-- <p>The website is available <a href="https://chan4077-material2-docs.firebaseapp.com">here</a>.</p> -->
    <p>The website is available <a href="https://chan4077.github.io/material-docs">here</a>.</p>
    <p>However, it doesn't have every single doc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/Chan4077/MyFirstGame"><code>MyFirstGame</code></a>
    <p>This is a dice roller app which basically does, you got it, dice rolling. Although there are rumors that rolling the dice
      a number of times would do something... ðŸ¤”</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't really have much time nowadays to complete these projects.</p>
<p>Anyways, I would also like to implement these features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Disqus support</li>
  <li>Breadcrumbs in the toolbar (completed)</li>
</ul>

<p>And in case you wanted to know, you can view the website's source code <a href="https"</p>
